# Steam Authentication
Login using your Steam account

## Reqiurements
SMF 2.0.x

This mod will allow users to login via the Steam OpenID integration (OpenID is a core SMF feature, btw, though it's buggy).

User will be silently created using data obtained from Steam: player name, avatar, and date created.

##Foreword

Thanks goes to:
- JTX for the original steam openid script (http://pastebin.com/6vZT4RhD)
- The LightopenID library (http://gitorious.org/lightopenid)
 * The library requires PHP >= 5.1.2 with curl or http/https stream wrappers enabled.
